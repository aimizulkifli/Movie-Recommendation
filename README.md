# Movie-Recommendation
Machine Learning: Movie recommendation using SVD, SVD++, NMF, HybridSVD and ExtendedSVD

This study focuses on enhancing the accuracy of movie recommendations through a technique called collaborative filtering. Specifically, we integrate side information about movies, such as genres, credits, and keywords, into a method known as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This integration allows us to make more accurate predictions about missing movie ratings, providing a better understanding of each movieâ€™s unique features. We aim to increase the overall accuracy of our movie recommendation system. Through thorough experiments and analysis, we compare our approach to established methods like original SVD, SVD++, and NMF, without side information. This allows us to better understand the recommendation algorithms and highlights the significant potential of our enhancement.
